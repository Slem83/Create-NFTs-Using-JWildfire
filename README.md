How to Create NFTs Using JWildfire...
I am a professional developer and designer, and I love to create inspirational, creative, and fun imagery and designs. My goal is to not only educate but hopefully inspire. I will take a comprehensive look at education for pre-k to adult content and offer free content. My Cryptoc LLC business will consist of three divisions of services from crypto mining services (education, news, renewable resources, and job creation), design services (for-profit and education), pre-k - teen education, and adult education (finances and credit). I have worked closely with several industry professionals and individuals on many levels of complexities to achieve your goals and visions. Be prepared to be professional, glamorous, creative, fun, and make a lasting impression.
You can go to https://github.com/thargor6/JWildfire if you want to utilize the open source version of JWildfire, but for educational purposes and ease for beginer use I will be using the paid version that I downloaded under my Steam account.
I will be providing step by step processes as I show how I create my fractal NFT's.
